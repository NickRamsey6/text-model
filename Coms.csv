I had originally applied for a Part Time position I was very interested in, the pay was perfect. That afternoon of applying for p/t work, I received a call from my local Adecco office and was offered a full time position that ""would be a better match and pay was only off by half a dollar"" BUT rather than receiving info for the p/t position. Don't get me wrong, I accepted the f/t offer (although it was in fact the type of work I was NOT seeking for a change But I couldn't afford not to. I was trained 1 wk put on the phones alone on wk 2 and by the beginning of wk 3 was told by the manager of that dept that the position was not going to be hiring on and the end of month my contract would end. I was surprised especially not having heard from anyone over at Adecco. The manager then offered me an interview with another dept. I accepted as well as emailed Adecco in regards to what was going on and was told to call at my 30 min lunch to discuss. I did not follow up. The interview was the very next day. Nothing was discussed about contract terms nor pay at that time. I was then extended the offer and that is when I was contacted by Adecco to let me know and needed my answer by the next day at the latest. At this time job duties were gone over. As i accepted the position again because I need my job before call was over is when I was notified that my pay would be cut by $1.50. when questioning it, was told all that they couldnt do anything since it was what the company was paying for this position of inbound Credit reps. I feel that if I was notified of this ASAP by Adecco with other job offers as options to allow me to choose one in where at least the pay rate I know I am needing in order to survive. So with that being said I feel as I was forced to settle for a position and pay that I was not satisfied with. Also, this  has lead to no contact from anyone at Adecco. As well as a no response in regards to an email I sent in to notify I would be running later. I got to work to find they had been notified but I wasn't acknowledged, even in responding to let her know I was in and that I wanted to see when a good time would be for me to go into the office to discuss the cut in pay I was offered.

CPM and Program Managers are full time remote workers while all Ops Leads work on site, resulting in lack or leadership or support for issues. Arranging travel with Program Manager is excruciating painful and lacks clear communication. Several times hotel was booked without credit card on file, requiring balance of thousands of dollars to be paid off using personal credit card upon checkout. Program Manager, without consulting, booked a cross country flight with a layover that actually cost more than a direct flight. Had to escalate to CPM in order to save money and fly direct. Adecco does not do anything to show they value their workers. Office lacks positive culture, check-ins, annual reviews, or anything to make Ops Leads feel they are part of a team.
